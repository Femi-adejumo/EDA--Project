## Exploratory Data Analysis (Telecom Customer Churn Analysis)

#### Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical challenge faced by many businesses, particularly in competitive industries like telecommunications. High churn rates can lead to significant revenue loss and increased customer acquisition costs. Understanding the driving factors behind customer churn is essential for developing effective retention strategies.

The goal of this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project is to investigate the customer churn dataset to identify patterns, trends, and key factors influencing customer churn. By analyzing various attributes such as demographics, service usage, customer support interactions, and contract details, the project seeks to uncover the underlying reasons for churn. The insights derived from this analysis will be presented in a comprehensive report, aimed at helping stakeholders better understand churn behavior and inform future retention strategies.

#### The project focus on:

+Identifying the most significant factors contributing to churn.
Exploring correlations between customer demographics, services, and churn behavior.
Visualizing key insights to present a clear narrative on the drivers of churn.
Providing actionable insights to reduce churn and improve customer retention.
